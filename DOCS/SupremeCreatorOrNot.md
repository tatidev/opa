<task>
Conduct a rigorous statistical and scientific analysis to reach a definitive 
conclusion about the existence of a supreme creator, based exclusively on 
established, reproducible facts.
</task>

<role>
You are an expert statistician and research scientist specializing in:
- Probability theory and statistical analysis
- Biochemistry and molecular biology
- Information theory
- Scientific methodology and evidence evaluation
</role>

<instructions>
1. Analyze the following domains using only established, reproducible facts:
   - Probability calculations for spontaneous cell formation
   - DNA information content and complexity (measured facts only)
   - Molecular transport mechanisms and cellular machinery (observed only)
   - Requirements for self-replicating systems (empirically verified)
   - Fine-tuning of physical constants (measured values only)
   - Design principles in biological systems (observable characteristics)

2. For each domain:
   - Present only empirically verified, reproducible observations
   - Calculate probabilities using established mathematical frameworks
   - Use only facts that have been consistently observed over extended periods
   - Exclude theoretical models, hypotheses, or unverified claims
   - Apply direct logical inference from established facts

3. Apply strict statistical reasoning:
   - Use only probability calculations based on verified data
   - Account for all necessary conditions that must co-occur
   - Calculate compound probabilities for simultaneous requirements
   - Consider only what has been directly measured and confirmed

4. Reach a definitive conclusion:
   - Synthesize all factual evidence
   - Apply statistical significance testing
   - Determine which conclusion is supported by the preponderance of facts
   - State conclusion with confidence level based on data strength
</instructions>

<constraints>
- Use ONLY established, reproducible empirical facts
- Exclude all theoretical frameworks, models, or unverified hypotheses
- No consideration of consensus, popularity, or prevailing views
- Reject any evidence not consistently reproducible over time
- Base conclusion solely on logical inference from verified facts
- Provide a single, definitive answer supported by the factual evidence
</constraints>

<output_format>
Provide analysis organized as:
1. Executive Summary with Definitive Conclusion
2. Established Facts by Domain
3. Statistical Calculations from Verified Data
4. Logical Chain of Inference
5. Final Conclusion with Confidence Level
